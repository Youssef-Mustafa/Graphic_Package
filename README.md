### Features

1. **Draw Lines**
    - **Bresenham's Algorithm**: Efficient line drawing algorithm that uses integer calculations.
    - **DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Algorithm**: Line drawing algorithm that uses floating-point calculations.

2. **Draw Circles**
    - **Bresenham's Midpoint Circle Algorithm**: An efficient algorithm to draw circles using integer arithmetic.

3. **Draw Ellipses**
    - **Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm**: Used for drawing ellipses with high accuracy and performance.

4. **Geometric Transformations**
    - **Translation**: Moving shapes from one place to another.
    - **Reflection**: Flipping shapes over a specified axis.
    - **Rotation**: Rotating shapes around a point.
    - **Scaling**: Resizing shapes proportionally.
    - **Shearing**: Slanting shapes by altering their coordinates.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a menu to choose from various drawing and transformation options.

### Drawing Shapes

1. **Draw Line**:
    - Select either Bresenham's Algorithm or DDA Algorithm.
    - Input the start and end points of the line.
    - Press the 'Draw' button to render the line.

2. **Draw Circle**:
    - Input the center and radius of the circle.
    - Press the 'Draw' button to render the circle using Bresenham's Midpoint Circle Algorithm.

3. **Draw Ellipse**:
    - Input the center and radii of the ellipse.
    - Press the 'Draw' button to render the ellipse.

### Applying Transformations

1. **Translation**:
    - Select the shape and input the translation distances (dx, dy).
    - Press the 'Apply Transformation' button to translate the shape.

2. **Reflection**:
    - Select the shape and choose the axis (x-axis or y-axis) for reflection.
    - Press the 'Apply Transformation' button to reflect the shape.

3. **Rotation**:
    - Select the shape and input the rotation angle.
    - Press the 'Apply Transformation' button to rotate the shape around the origin.

4. **Scaling**:
    - Select the shape and input the scaling factors (sx, sy).
    - Press the 'Apply Transformation' button to scale the shape.

5. **Shearing**:
    - Select the shape and input the shearing factors (shx, shy).
    - Press the 'Apply Transformation' button to shear the shape.
